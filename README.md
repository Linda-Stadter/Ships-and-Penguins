# Ships and Penguins

Ships and Penguins is a game based on particle systems developed by two students. We wrote our own physics engine from scratch within the scope this project. It includes simulations of fluid, cloth and rigid body particles interacting with each other. We developed this game with CUDA and C++ and used the rendering framework saiga.

# Game Description

The player navigates a boat equipped with a cannon through the sea using the arrow keys. The cannon is operated by the mouse. Using the space bar, the player can fire two different types of fish: A heavy and round puffer fish and a lighter and elongated swordfish. These can be exchanged with the number keys. After firing, the player must wait until the cannon has been reloaded.

Points are scored by hitting the sail of an enemy boat or the boat itself. In addition, extra points are awarded for hitting an enemy penguin.
If after three shots not a single point has been scored or the timer has expired, the game is over and the high score appears.
